# GEL Tools

A set of useful Sass functions & mixins that are required by the GEL Foundations.

This repository forms part of the the [GEL Foundations](https://github.com/bbc/gel-foundations).

The following tools are currently included:

- **Math** - a collection of simple math functions which can be used when working with the `$gel-spacing-unit`
- **REM** - a tool to convert `px` values to `rem` units. The conversion logic is based on [Guss REM](https://github.com/guardian/guss-rem), with additional options added to give more control over the returned output.

## Installation

We recommend that you use a package manager ([Bower](http://bower.io/) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/)) to install this component. Using a package manager will make it easier for you to handle any updates made to this component, it will also automatically manage the dependancies of this component for you.

### Install using Bower

```Shell
$ bower install --save https://github.com/bbc-gel/gel-tools.git
```

Once installed, use a Sass `@import` to bring the component into your project:

```Sass
@import 'bower_components/gel-tools/tools.math';
@import 'bower_components/gel-tools/tools.rem';
```

### Install using NPM

[Coming Soon]

### Install manually

You can install this component manually by downloading the content of this Git repo into your project and use a Sass `@import` to include it in your project.

> **Note:** you will manually need to manage the depedencies below, without these this component will fail to compile.

## Dependencies

In order to use the GEL Tools component you will need the following component available:

- [GEL Settings](https://github.com/bbc-gel/gel-settings)

> **Note:** This component requires [Sass 3.3.x](http://blog.sass-lang.com/posts/184094-sass-33-is-released) to make use of [Sass Maps](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#maps) and various other features.

## Usage

Usage of the included tools is as follows:

### Math

The following `math` functions are included:

- `quarter($value)`
- `havle($value)`
- `double($value)`
- `quadruple($value)`

These functions can be used inline with any numberical CSS rule. E.g:

```Sass
.some-class {
    margin-bottom: havle($gel-spacing-unit);
    padding-left: double($gel-spacing-unit);
    padding-right: double($gel-spacing-unit);
}
```

or functions can be nested within other Sass features such as mixins:

```Sass
.some-class {
    @include rem('margin-bottom', havle($gel-spacing-unit));
    @include rem('padding-left', double($gel-spacing-unit));
    @include rem('padding-right', double($gel-spacing-unit))s;
}
```

### REM

The `rem` tool can be used in two ways. Either by directly calling the `rem($value)` function, which will convert the supplied value and return a `rem` unit. E.g:

```Sass
.some-class {
    margin-bottom: rem($gel-spacing-unit);
}
```

> Beware that [rem](http://caniuse.com/#feat=rem) units are not universial supported. Currently IE8 and below and Opera Mobile do not support `rem` so require a `px` fallback.

You can also use the `@include rem($value);` mixin, which by default returns a `px` fallback to allow support for older browsers which don't support `rem` units. E.g:

**Sass**
```Sass
.some-class {
    @include rem('margin-bottom', 16px);
}
```

**CSS**
```CSS
.some-class {
    margin-bottom: 16px;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

## Options

The following options can be defined before the tools partials are included to customise the functionaility and output. By default the following options are all set to `true`:

- `$gel-tools-rem-enable--function` - enable/disable the rem conversion, if this option is disabled only `px` values will be returned
- `$gel-tools-rem-enable--mixin` - disable the mixin if you only want to output the `px`, this can be useful for IE8 stylesheets who don't need `rem` values
- `$tel-tools-rem-enable--fallback` - disable the automatic generation of a `px` fallback when the mixin in called, use this open if you want to remove all `px` values from your stylesheets
